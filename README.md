# **Research Question**
The research question is to explore the correlation between terrorist attacks in Pakistan and the US foreign aid to Pakistan for the corresponding year.
Pakistan has used terrorists as a militia to attain its foreign policy goals. However, over time these terrorists have turned against their own masters and have carried out terrorist activities in Pakistan. In spite of the increasing terrorist activities, Pakistan continues to provide a safe haven to terrorists, which is reflected in the increasing terrorist incidents in the country.
At the same time successive US presidents have demanded that Pakistan do more to clamp down on terrorism in its own country. US officials believe that they can force Pakistan to do so by controlling the amount of foreign aid given to the country. We attempt to test if the US officials walk the talk â€“ has the foreign aid reduced as terrorist activities increase in Pakistan or there has been no change.
